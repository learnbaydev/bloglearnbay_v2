<span style=" font-weight:bold; font-size:28px">A Comprehensive Guide to Ace Top-tier IOT Careers in 2024<span>

IoTs commonly referred to as the Internet of Things, was introduced by Kevin Ashton in 1999. In simple terms, these are the gadgets that communicate with other gadgets without the requirement for human intelligence. It does not fall into a separate category of machines or systems.</br>

These can be anything, starting from networks to sensors owing a UID (Unique Identifiers). The application of IoTs is mainly where there is a need for automation. It joins the real and tech worlds together. As the world is evolving digitally, so, it brings a <b>career in Internet of Things</b> with it.</br>

So, are you interested in <b>IoT jobs</b>? But, Internet surfing doesn't give you compiled information on **IoT careers**. Then this blog is the ultimate guide to pursuing a <b>career in Internet of Things in 2024</b>.</br>

Want to relate more to the Internet of Things (IoTs)?</br>

## Let's see some instances that we generally come across daily but are unaware of being IoT.

1. <b>Smart home gadgets-</b> This innovation saves electricity consumption and also makes people's lives easier. For example, smart lights don't need human involvement to switch them on or off. It detects the motion availability around it and manages itself accordingly. These home systems use Wi-Fi and other security systems to serve you with your daily duties. In the case of intelligent room heaters, they adjust the room temperature according to your mood.
   <br/>
2. <b>Fitness bands-</b> These are the ubiquitous gadgets we encounter daily. They associate with smartphones, and other gadgets to share data. It also traces GPS via internet connectivity.
   <br/>
3. <b>Wearable glucose monitors-</b> currently, the medical and fitness industries use these technologies to a great extent. The wearable glucose monitors detect any spike in glucose levels. Then it sends the data to the patient's smartphone, thus alerting them.
   <br/>
4. <b>Self-driven cars-</b> This IoT technology uses special features like sensors and real-time monitoring through wireless connections. This involves transferring camera images and reacting to traffic lights.
   </br>

By now, you have an overview of IoT and the products that use IoT technologies.</br>

Going forward in this blog,</br>

<b>Let's focus on the required education, trending job choices, and salary perks for professionals aiming for careers.</b></br></br>

<Image src="https://dye9dtwtg1p5q.cloudfront.net/learnbay-blog-v2/IoT.png" style="width:100%" class="img" alt="An image shows the necessary skills for an IOT engineer shows a person pointing to the logo of IOT."/></br></br>

## Necessary Skills for an IOT Engineer

An IOT engineer must have programming knowledge, various technical skills, and an understanding of IoT concepts.</br>

- <b>Programming Knowledge-</b> It demands expertise in programming like Python, C++, and Java. These languages, in general, are used in preliminary programming and fix systems. The usage of Java, on the other hand, is primarily for developing getaways and servers. The use of Python is due to its library support, easily readable nature, and clarity.</br>
- <b>Hardware proficiency-</b> The knowledge of hardware helps an IoT professional to build efficient IoT applications—for example, actuators, sensors, AVR microcontrollers, etc.</br>
- <b>IoT protocol and Networking-</b> IoT protocol designing as per the application's operation and need. A few common examples of networking include LTE, Wifi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, etc. DDS, HTTP, CoAP, MQTT, etc. are IoT protocols. This is essential to set up connectivity between the gadget and the cloud.</br>
- <b>Data analysis-</b> One of the Key elements for an IoT product is generating and transferring it to multiple platforms. So, an individual planning to develop an IoT solution has to focus on this while designing. With data management and analysis, an IoT can perform.</br>
- <b>Security building-</b> Gaining the popularity of IoT products has made it prone to hackers and cybersecurity. Knowing security networks is a necessity. For example, end-to-end encryption, password protection, and verification are essential to protect IoT systems.</br>
- <b>Data Visualization-</b> Without being able to analyze and interpret data, IoT systems will fail to perform the desired functions. So commands on some essential data visualization tools like Tableau, MATLAB, etc. are crucial.</br>
- <b>Cloud Evaluation-</b> Generating vast amounts of data also demands storage. These IoT systems mainly use various servers and clouds for storing data. So, gaining hands-on training on cloud evaluating tools, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure IoT, etc., is paramount.</br>
- <b>Machine learning-</b> Advancements in IoT technologies made the merging of machines and artificial intelligence necessary. It thus becomes essential to learn data analytics, predictive analysis, and the foundation of AI. For example, TensorFlow and PyTorch make it easy to construct IoT robots.</br>
- <b>Logical reasoning-</b> For an IoT engineer, learning logical reasoning is vital. Understanding the above subjects prepares you to be an IoT engineer. However, troubleshooting complex problems due to IoT solutions requires a practical mindset and logical thinking.</br>
- <b>Numerous collaborations-</b> Developing IoT products usually requires operating with cross-sectional teams and departments. Building successful IoT solutions requires prompt communication and collaboration across teams and stakeholders.</br></br>
