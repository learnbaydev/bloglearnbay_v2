_Before that, let us understand algorithms._  <br/>

## The Algorithms in Brief

An algorithm is a vital part of DSA that helps the developers or coders with a set of instructions to resolve a problem. Since its evolution, the term algorithm has been witnessed in each field. Algorithms are useful in various ways, from decoding an attacker’s next move to making job-related decisions. In the computer science stream, the term algorithm is widely used, and it helps the users to solve any problem with a few steps. Anyone who is upskilled with a <b>data structures and algorithms course</b> can experience these uses in real-time.  <br/>

The system reads the concern presented by the user and processes it with the use of algorithms. After this step is completed, it generates instructions that the user must follow to solve their problem. Algorithms use various tools like natural language processing, programming languages, and flow charts in order to decode and transmit accurate information. The experts upskilled through a <b>data structures and algorithms course online</b> can work with these tools and reach a solution.  <br/>

The ancient years and certain instances are clear evidence of real-time uses of algorithms in the world. Let us know more.  <br/> <br/>

## How to Refine Your Programming Expertise?   

Improving programming skills is vital for shaping a tech career in this digital era. Upskilling through a <b>data structures and algorithms course online</b> can help you strengthen your coding skills. Yet, refining coding skills will require ‘measuring the level or efficiency of the code’ at first. Measuring the coding efficiency can help the experts identify and address the loopholes Anyway, this will require an intervention of time complexity.  <br/><br/>


### Time Complexity 

An instance of the time complexity of search algorithms is as follows:

Let's take a detailed look at the example below to obtain more knowledge about the time complexity of search algorithms. In this section, we'll contrast two distinct problem-solving methods. The issue that we shall discuss now is being researched.

Let's imagine that we need to find a certain element in an array that has been organized in ascending order. We now have two algorithms for addressing this issue:

1. Linear Search.

2. Binary Search

Consider an array of five items, and where we need to locate the number 24 in the array.

<Image src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main-blog/blog/snp-1.jpeg" style="width:50%" class="img" alt="A snippet shows an example of time complexity under search algorithm. This example shows 'constant array' and 'constant search_value' as variables."/> <br/>

_Fig1: Locate the number in a constant array_ <br/>


The linear search method will now compare each member of the array to a certain search_value when we search. Now, it must return true if the search_value is identified. That seems easy, right? If not, practical learning with a <b>data structures and algorithms course online</b> can make it easy. 

Let's now check the total number of operations required for it to return its result. Since it compares each member of the array individually, we arrive at number 5 as the response. We can now state that the provided element is found using linear search using a maximum of five operations. In the situation of linear search, this is typically the worst possible scenario for an algorithm.

To summarize, in the worst scenario, the linear search requires 'n' operations (<b>where 'n' is represented as array size</b>).

Let's now look at the Binary search method in detail using an easy example.

<Image src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main-blog/blog/snp-2.jpeg" style="width:50%" class="img" alt="A snippet shows an example of time complexity under Binary Search algorithm. This example shows 'constant array' and 'constant search_value' as variables."/> <br/>

_Fig 2: Binary Search Method_ <br/>


Now for the provided array, if we had to implement the binary search method to identify the search_value  we would start by looking in the center of the array. Now that the array's center element is 24, we analyze to see whether 24 > 21, so we start looking left by looking at the items to the left. We notice that we will discover a number, say 7, and since 7 &lt; 21, we start looking for the desired element, and once we reach 21, we compare 21 = 21.

When we count the number of steps, the binary search required to identify the target element, we realize that it took four rounds. This demonstrates why the binary search utilizes a logarithmic technique.

<Image src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main-blog/blog/snp-3.jpeg" style="width:50%" class="img" alt="A snippet shows an example of binary search method to identify the search_value."/> <br/>

_Fig 3: Binary search (2)_ <br/>



When using a binary search technique, the standard form is expressed as

The number of steps executed by the Binary Search for an array of size n is: log(n) <br/>


### Asymptotic Analysis 


#### Big-O Notation 

Big-O notation refers to the expression of the maximum running time allowed for an algorithm. Thus, it reflects the <b>worst-case complexity</b>. Further knowledge can be gained if you enroll in a <b>data structures and algorithms course online</b>. <br/>

<b>Here, ‘O’ in Big-O Notation refers to the order of a function. </b>

<Image src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main-blog/blog/snp-4.jpeg" style="width:50%" class="img" alt="A snippet shows a graph representing Big-O Notation."/> <br/>

Here, <b>cg(n): positive constant </b>

<b>f(n): function</b> 

_Fig 4: Big O Notation Graph_ <br/>

<Image src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main-blog/blog/snp-5.jpeg" style="width:50%" class="img" alt="A snippet shows an example of code representing Big-O Notation."/> <br/>

_Fig 5: Big O Notation Graph Interpretation_ <br/>

The statement above could be expressed as a function f(n) about the set O(g(n)) if a positive constant c is found that stands between 0 and cg(n), for enough big n.

Take a random value for n, the duration of the execution of an algorithm never exceeds the time given by O(g(n).

Since we are always keen on the worst-case situation, it is frequently used to examine an algorithm since it provides the worst-case execution time of an algorithm. To know better, you must enroll in a <b>data structures and algorithms course online</b>. <br/>

<b>Example 1: </b> <br/>

Calculate the upper bound time of execution of the constant function f(n) = 6993.

We must identify c and n0 such that 0 ≤ f (n) ≤ c.g(n) for every n ≥ n0 to identify the upper bound of f(n).

0 ≤ f (n) ≤ c × g (n)

0 ≤ 6993 ≤ c × g (n)

0 ≤ 6993 ≤ 6993 x 1

So, c = 6993 and g(n) = 1

The above inequalities are satisfied by any value of c bigger than 6993, making all such values of c feasible.

0 ≤ 6993 ≤ 8000 x 1 → true

0 ≤ 6993 ≤ 10500 x 1 → true

The constant function f(n) does not change with the size n of the problem, So n0= 1

f(n) = O(g(n)) = O(1) for c = 6993, n0 = 1

f(n) = O(g(n)) = O(1) for c = 8000, n0 = 1  and so on. <br/>

<b>Example 2:</b> <br/>

Identify the upper limit of the running time of a linear function f(n) = 6n + 3.

To identify the upper bound of f(n) We must locate c and n0 such that 0 ≤ f (n) ≤ c x g (n) for every n≥n0.

0  ≤  f (n) ≤ c × g (n)

0  ≤  6n + 3 ≤ c × g (n)

0  ≤  6n + 3 ≤ 6n + 3n,  for all n ≥ 1 (There are such endless possibilities)

0  ≤  6n + 3 ≤ 9n

So, c = 9 and g (n) = n,  n0 = 1  <br/>

<b>Tabular Approach</b> <br/>

0 ≤ 6n + 3 ≤ c × g (n)

0 ≤ 6n + 3 ≤ 7 n

Now, manually identify the correct n0, such that f (n) ≤ c.g (n)

<Image src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main-blog/blog/snp-6.jpeg" style="width:50%" class="img" alt="A snippet shows an example of tabular approach representing Big-O Notation."/> <br/>

_Fig 6: Tabular Approach_ <br/>


According to the table, for n ≥ 3, f (n) ≤ c × g (n) holds true. So, c = 7, g(n) = n, and n0 = 3, There could be such multiple pairs of (c, n0)

f(n) = O(g(n)) = O(n) for c = 9, n0 = 1

f(n) = O(g(n)) = O(n) for c = 7, n0 = 3

and so on.

The learners with proven skills after learning through a <b>data structures and algorithms course online</b>, can solve these problems.  <br/><br/>


### Omega Notation (Ω-notation)

<Image src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main-blog/blog/snp-7.jpeg" style="width:50%" class="img" alt="A snippet of graph represents Omega Notation"/> <br/>

_Fig 7: Omega Notation Graph_ <br/>

<Image src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main-blog/blog/snp-8.jpeg" style="width:50%" class="img" alt="A snippet shows an example of code representing Omega Notation."/> <br/>

_Fig 8: Omega Notation Graph Interpretation_ <br/>

The statement above could be interpreted as a function f(n) about the set Ω(g(n)) if there is a positive constant c that stands above cg(n) for sufficiently big n.

The <b>algorithm's lowest execution time is provided by Ω(g(n))</b> for any value of n. <br/>

<b>Example:</b> <br/>

Identify the lower limit of the time of execution of linear function f(n) = 6n + 3.

To determine the lower limit of f(n), we must identify c and n0 so that 0 ≤ c.g(n) ≤ f(n) for all n ≥ n0.

0 ≤ c × g(n) ≤ f(n)

0 ≤ c × g(n) ≤ 6n + 3

0 ≤ 6n ≤ 6n + 3 → true, for all n ≥ n0

0 ≤ 5n ≤ 6n + 3 → true, for all n ≥ n0

Both of the above discrepancies are true, and there are never-ending inequalities. So,

f(n) = Ω (g(n)) = Ω (n) for c = 6, n0 = 1

f(n) = Ω (g(n)) = Ω (n) for c = 5, n0 = 1

and so on.

After getting upskilled through a <b>data structures and algorithms course online</b>, you will be able to solve these tasks well.  <br/><br/>


### Theta Notation (Θ-notation)

The above as well as below functions are included in theta notation. Since it reflects the upper and lower limits of the duration of execution of an algorithm, it is utilized to check the average-case complexity of an algorithm.

<Image src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main-blog/blog/snp-9.jpeg" style="width:50%" class="img" alt="A snippet shows a graph representing Theta Notation."/> <br/>

_Fig 9: Theta Notation Graph_ <br/>

<Image src="https://learnbay-wb.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/main-blog/blog/snp-10.jpeg" style="width:50%" class="img" alt="A snippet shows an example of code representing Theta Notation."/> <br/>

_Fig 10: Theta Notation Graph Interpretation_ <br/>


The above equation could be said that the function f(n) belongs to the set Θ(g(n)) If there are positive constants c1 and c2 that are positioned between c1g(n) and c2g(n), for an adequate big n.

A function is considered to be an asymptotically tight limit if it lies somewhere between c1g(n) as well as c2g(n) for every n≥ n0. <br/>

<b>Example:</b> <br/>

Identify the tight limit of the execution time of constant function f(n) = 23.

To identify the tight limit of f(n), we need to identify c1, c2, and n0 so that, 0 ≤ c1× g(n) ≤ f(n)  ≤ c2 × g(n)  for all n ≥ n0

0 ≤ c1× g(n) ≤ 23 ≤ c2 × g(n)

0 ≤ 22 ×1 ≤ 23 ≤ 24 × 1, → true for all n ≥ 1

0 ≤ 10 ×1 ≤ 23 ≤ 50 × 1, → true for all n ≥ 1

Both of the above inequalities are indicated true, and there exist never-ending inequalities.

So,  (c1, c2) = (22, 24) and g(n) = 1, for all n ≥ 1

(c1, c2) = (10, 50) and g(n) = 1, for all n ≥ 1

f(n) = Θ (g (n)) = Θ (1) for c1 = 22, c2 = 24, n0 = 1

f(n) = Θ (g (n)) = Θ (1) for c1 = 10, c2 = 50, n0 = 1

and so on. <br/><br/>
