## What is a good career goal in data science? 

It is helpful to learn about some features of a good data science career goal. 

 ### • Achievable

Set small goals that you are sure to achieve and slowly build your confidence. Make sure to share obtainable goals with your peers and managers so that you create a good reputation. Your career goals should not be affected by external factors like other commitments or time constraints.<br>

 ### • Measured 

The goals should be measurable, meaning there should be no doubt regarding the goal's completion. For instance, in order to acquire knowledge on regression topics, it is advisable to establish precise and quantifiable objectives on the subjects to measure the progress of your activity.<br>



 ### • Time-specific       

Setting time frames where you can complete some tasks is essential. It further specifies the goals and helps analyze how far you have to go. Your goals should also be visibly clear, so you may assess progress.<br> <br>


## Tips for selecting the best data science online programs 


### Tip 1:- Evaluate the learning goals

While searching for the right program, you may observe they mostly cover the same type of materials. The course material can be similar, but an online certification in data science may provide certain focus areas where you can specialize in a particular field. 

You should keep in mind some questions that can help you select the right course. These questions should match your professional goals. You may ask the following questions, such as:

* _What kind of professional level of experience do you have?_
* _Do you want the beginner or advanced course?_
* _What skills do you need to acquire to start with the chosen course?_
* _Do you wish to qualify for a specific job?_
* _Are you joining to increase your pay or become a field expert?_

Knowledge of your career/professional goals provides a clear picture of the program you need. You may enroll in the program that offers the necessary tools and resources. You can also determine if you should focus on a specification in your field. <br> <br>


### Tip 2:- Find out the requirements.

After evaluating career goals, you should outline what skills and qualifications the data science job requires. Most jobs require specific skill sets, which you may not have. Therefore, try to research and find out the requirements that you need to gain or improve. <br>

You can try to read multiple job posts to figure out the most in-demand skills and qualifications for a data science job. Based on these, you can find out the preferable program covering such areas.<br><br>

### Tip 3:- Do some research    

Research the best data science online programs to evaluate the class timings and structure, skills, and reputation of the institution providing the program. Find out the eligibility criteria as well for these programs. You can also go through the student reviews to better understand the course.<br>

You can also find out if the program provides any perks to students, like doubt-clearing sessions or career counseling. Furthermore, you will get a clear picture of the type of educational facilities or care given to students and can compare the institutes to find the most suited. <br>

_If you get any institute that offers offline doubt clearance sessions, you should never miss that opportunity. Although 95% of courses are completely online, try to find a course that offers offline sessions for mock interviews, doubt clearing, resume building, and projects._

### Tip 4:- Decide your ideal learning environment    

In this fast-paced age, many want to complete their education as fast and efficiently as possible. You might find various programs that unify in-person, online, and hybrid classes. Depending on your career goals, requirements, and mode of study, you can find the optimal learning environment.

This type of learning environment is most preferable for working guys. However, the efficacy of completing online classes is only 10% when it comes to a successful career transition. 

**Hybrid classes:** This is the best and most effective option for working pros. These classes provide students with an online live learning experience for theoretical parts. Alongside this, they can choose offline sessions for all the career support, doubt clearance, and capstone projects. Students in hybrid classes <b>learn data science online</b> and practice real-world capstone projects offline. Here, Learners can complete their education online through mentors and also enhance their networking skills.<br> <br>


### Tip 5:- Ensure the authenticity and acceptance level of learning in the industry   

Certification is not everything- it’s true. Still, recruiters need some recognition of your learning. It’s always safe to go with such learning courses that offer global industrial recognition. Couple with IBM. Microsolft-like certificate affiliations are the good ones. But better to enroll in a course that certifies your practical experience too. Here, nothing can be the best like a course offering <b>project experience certification from IBM or Microsoft</b>. <br>
